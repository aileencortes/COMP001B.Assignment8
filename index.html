        <h1> Assignment 8 Questions </h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <h2> What worked well over the last eight weeks and aided your learning process?</h2>
            <p> Something that helped me a lot were the slides because I couldn't really attend in 
                person lectures. A website that als0 helped me a lot is  <a href="https://www.w3schools.com"> 
                W3Schools</a>because they have examples, how to's and let you run and test codes so you can 
                understand how it works.
            </p>
        <br>
        <h2> What would you like to change about the course?</h2>
            <p> Something that I liked about the course was the fact that I could do it remotely, because it 
                really helped with my circumstances. Another thing I liked was that anytime I needed help the 
                professor was able to communicate and help me understand.
            </p>
        <br>
        <h2> Did you learn what you expected to learn in this course?</h2>
            <p> Yes, overall I think I grasped a slightly better understanding on how to use CSS 
                and what ways to not use CSS. 
            </p>
         <br>
        <h2> What concepts were new to you, and what concepts have you already encountered?</h2>
            <p> Something new to me was understand Bootstrap. Personally I still don't have a good 
                idea on how to fully use it but I do see how it's helpful to many programmers once 
                they understand how to utilize it.
